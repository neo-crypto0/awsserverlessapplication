## Serverless Web App on AWS ‚Äì IAC with Terraform
This repository contains a serverless application on AWS that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee records. The architecture implements a secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution using AWS managed services.It  provisions a complete serverless architecture on AWS using **Terraform**
Note: WAF and CodePipeline are not included in the Terraform scripts and need to be configured manually if required. The application functions correctly even without them.
### üîß Features
	
	- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using **Terraform**
	- Serverless architecture built using AWS services
	- Fully automated CI/CD with AWS CodePipeline
	- Real-time application monitoring and logging using CloudWatch
	- RESTful API for managing employees (Create, Read, Delete)
	- Static frontend hosted via Amazon S3 + CloudFront CDN
	- Backend logic implemented using AWS Lambda (Python)
	- Secure with AWS WAF, IAM roles, and scoped permissions

  ### ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

1. **Install Terraform**
2. Clone this repository
3. Initialize Terraform:
```
terraform init
```  

4. To provision
```
terraform apply
```

5.  Copy the invoke URL and update the value of API_ENDPOINT variable is script.js file.


### üß± Architecture Overview

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65fffe4a-c05a-4245-8aa1-d40d33cdbc97)

	‚Ä¢ Frontend: HTML/JS static site hosted on Amazon S3
	‚Ä¢ Backend: Python-based Lambda functions
	‚Ä¢ API Layer: RESTful API via Amazon API Gateway
	‚Ä¢ Database: Amazon DynamoDB for storing employee data
	‚Ä¢ CDN: CloudFront for global distribution and HTTPS access
	‚Ä¢ Security: AWS WAF + IAM roles + Security Groups + NACLs
	‚Ä¢ CI/CD: AWS CodePipeline with source, build, and deploy stages
	‚Ä¢ Monitoring: AWS CloudWatch for logs, alarms, and metrics

### üß∞ Prerequisites
	Before diving into building this serverless solution, it is important to ensure you have the following:
 
	‚Ä¢ AWS Account: You need an active AWS account to access and configure the various services such as Lambda, S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB, etc.
	‚Ä¢ AWS IAM: Familiarity with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is essential to manage user permissions, roles, and policies, especially for Lambda execution, DynamoDB access, and CodePipeline operations.
	‚Ä¢ Knowledge of AWS Lambda: You should have a basic understanding of AWS Lambda ‚Äî how to create functions, configure triggers, assign permissions, and deploy code using the console or CLI.
	‚Ä¢ Basic Knowledge of Python: Since all the backend logic is written in Python, it's important to be comfortable reading and writing simple Python scripts, especially for request parsing and interacting with DynamoDB.
	‚Ä¢ Understanding of REST APIs: Have a working knowledge of REST principles and HTTP methods like GET, POST, and DELETE, as these will be used when interacting with your API Gateway endpoints from the frontend.
	‚Ä¢ Basic Knowledge of CI/CD (Optional but Recommended): Knowing how AWS CodePipeline works will help you understand the automated build and deployment flow from source control (like GitHub) to Lambda and S3.
	‚Ä¢ CloudWatch Awareness: Familiarity with AWS CloudWatch will help you monitor logs, create alarms, and debug issues in Lambda, API Gateway, and other integrated services.
